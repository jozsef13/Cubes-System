A pyhton application where I had to implement a system with 3D coordinates, where we have some cubes placed. The 3D system is represented by a
table. I had to implement the following operations: 
- Initialization of the system of cubes
- Reading a list of coordinates for pairs of two points(a start point and a finish point)
- To determine for each pair from above, if there it is a road without interruptions, which leaves from the start point and ends in the finish
point and contains only points that belong to the exterior of any cube
- To determine if the system of cubes is balanced
